# Adventure-Sales-Order
## This project was conducted using Microsoft Excel to drive insights for the company, and the dataset was given to me by my mentor.
### This project reviews the sales trend over four years for a business starting from 2001 to 2004.
1. [An Excel file](AdventureSalesOrder1.xlsx) : This is an `excel` file that contains the `datasets` used for this analysis, and the insights drawn from it. it contains different information on each worksheet.

3. [Monthly Sales Trend](sales_1.png) : This was worked on using pivot tables, then after, it was visualized using line chart for easy understanding. it reviews that the month with high sales most of the time over the four years analyzed, is August.

4. [Offline/Online Orders](count_O.png) : We review the number of `orders` gotten from both platforms with 1 indicating `online`, and 0 indicating `offline`, with most order coming from the online space.

5. [Offline/Online Sales](O_O.png) : This chart talks about the total sales derived from both the online and offline sales using a `pie chart`, which reviews that much sales was generated from the `offline` despite their number of counts being smaller compared to the `online` count.

6. [Regional Sales](Regions_Sa.png) : We used `bar chart` here to review the top five `Regions` with the highest order, and discovered that `South West`, `Canada`, `North West`, `Australia`, `SOuth East` consecutively came top.
