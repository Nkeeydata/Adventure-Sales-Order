# Adventure-Sales-Order
## This project was conducted using Microsoft Excel to drive insights for the company, and the dataset was given to me by my mentor.
### This project reviews the sales trend over four years for a business starting from 2001 to 2004.

### Problem Overview : Adventure Company was experiencing some chalenges and needed to know about the below information ;
a. What is their `sales trend` on a monthly basis?
b. What `platform` did most of the orders came from?
c. Which `region` have the most sales?

1. [An Excel file](AdventureSalesOrder1.xlsx) : This is an `excel` file that contains the `datasets` used for this analysis, and the insights drawn from it. it contains different information on each worksheet.

2. [A Complete Dashboard](excel_1.jpg)The dashboard below reviews the summary of the insights gotten from the dataset showing the `Sales trend` on a monthly basis, and also the element used to filter for more indepth knowledge using the `Slicer`, the count of orders from the `online and offline` clients, and also their total sales generated from 

3. [Monthly Sales Trend](sales_1.png) : This was worked on using pivot tables, then after, it was visualized using line chart for easy understanding. it reviews that the month with high sales most of the time over the four years analyzed, is August.

4. [Offline/Online Orders](count_O.png) : We review the number of `orders` gotten from both platforms with 1 indicating `online`, and 0 indicating `offline`, with most order coming from the online space.

5. [Offline/Online Sales](O_O.png) : This chart talks about the total sales derived from both the online and offline sales using a `pie chart`, which reviews that much sales was generated from the `offline` despite their number of counts being smaller compared to the `online` count.

6. [Regional Sales](Regions_Sa.png) : We used `bar chart` here to review the top five `Regions` with the highest order, and discovered that `South West`, `Canada`, `North West`, `Australia`, `SOuth East` consecutively came top.

### Recommendation : 

Due to the fact that Adventure got most of their orders from the online platform, it is recommended that more security software be built to prevent cyber crime on the company's website.
Also, due to the high sales in the month of August, more products should be made available in the month of August, while promotions should be done in the month of January to increase sales due to the low sales usually recorded.
